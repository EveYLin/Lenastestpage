 # The sunniest city in Germany 

Freiburg markets itself as the city in German with most hours of **sunshine** over the year. On top, the city emphasizes its image as a *young, modern and innovative*. On this, see for example [Freiburg City Marketing](https://fwtm.freiburg.de/pb/761044.html). So then, why is it raining and why do students not know how to properly insert commas into their texts? (Well, I guess that is innovation)
